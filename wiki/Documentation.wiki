= Introduction =

gentics-sso-cas contains CAS server and client extensions and customizations to work in a portlet environment. It contains simple feature additions based on the CAS server and client.

== Server==

See CasServer for details.

  * Possibility to use a login form integrated into each service - instead of linking the user to a CAS login form with a backurl (as well as providing an on_error URL if login fails.) - Similar to http://www.ja-sig.org/wiki/display/CAS/Using+CAS+without+the+CAS+login+screen but without the hacks.
  * Build script to generated customized cas-server.war which can be immediately deployed.

== Client ==

See CasClient for details.

  * Sample login portlet which uses the newly introduced API from the server
  * Servlet filter to put the parameters of an authenticated Credential as a map into the servlet session.

== Oracle Bea Weblogic Server ==
